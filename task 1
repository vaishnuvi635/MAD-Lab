How to Install and Configure Flutter Environment
1. System Requirements
 Windows: Windows 10 or later (64-bit)
 macOS: macOS (64-bit)
 Linux: Any recent 64-bit distro

2. Download Flutter SDK
 Go to the official Flutter site:
https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
 Choose your OS (Windows/macOS/Linux)
 Download the latest stable Flutter SDK zip/archive.

3. Extract Flutter SDK
 Extract the downloaded archive to a suitable location:
o Windows: C:\src\flutter
o macOS/Linux: ~/development/flutter

4. Update PATH Environment Variable
You need to add Flutter’s bin directory to your system PATH.
 Windows:
1. Search for Environment Variables and open Edit the system environment variables.
2. Click Environment Variables.
3. Under System variables, find and select Path, then click Edit.
4. Click New and add the path to flutter\bin (e.g., C:\src\flutter\bin).
5. Click OK to save.

 macOS/Linux:
Open terminal and run:
export PATH=&quot;$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin&quot;
Or add the line below to your shell config file (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.):
export PATH=&quot;$PATH:[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_DIRECTORY]/flutter/bin&quot;

5. Verify Flutter Installation
Open a new terminal/command prompt and run:
flutter --version
You should see Flutter version info printed.

6. Run Flutter Doctor
Run this command to check your setup and see what else needs to be installed:
flutter doctor
This checks for:
 Dart SDK (bundled with Flutter)
 Android toolchain (Android SDK, platform tools)
 Xcode (macOS, for iOS development)
 Connected devices or emulators
 IDE plugins (VS Code, Android Studio)
Follow the instructions flutter doctor gives to fix any missing dependencies.

 Download and install Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/studio
 In Android Studio, install Android SDK and emulator via SDK Manager.
 Add Android SDK platform tools to PATH if needed.
 Create and run an Android emulator or connect a physical device with USB debugging
enabled.

8. Set Up VS Code or Android Studio IDE
 Install Flutter and Dart plugins in your preferred IDE.

 Open your Flutter project folder.
 You are ready to build and run Flutter apps!
